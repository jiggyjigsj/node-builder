# node-builder
A repo to host full node builder.

Things I want to accomplish
* Create directory structure
* Install docker-ce and docker-compose
* Land gdrive/tdrive suite with systemd config
  * land credentials (create a credential store)
* Land an auto updater (Weekly/Daily patches)
* Prep the node for k3os
* land cronjobs - SOT it, so its updated daily
* kubectx and kubectl
* rclone


Good to have
* Provision user with credentials
